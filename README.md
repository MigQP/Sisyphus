# Sisyphus

Sisyphus is a minimalist walking simulator where you use the left and right mouse buttons to manually control each step. Inspired by the myth of eternal struggle, the game challenges players to emulate the act of walking—one click at a time—capturing the rhythm, effort, and absurdity of the journey.
